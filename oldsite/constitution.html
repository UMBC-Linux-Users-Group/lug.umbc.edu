        <h3><a name="constitution_article3">Article III: Membership</a></h3>

        <p>To be eligible as a voting member, an individual must meet the criteria imposed on organization membership by the
        Student Government Association of UMBC. At this writing (4 November 1997), this means that the individual must be enrolled
        as an undergraduate student at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County.</p>

        <p>Voting membership shall be open to all eligible individuals regardless of race, color, creed, national origin, sex, age,
        sexual preference, physical and mental disability, or other external factor. This policy shall also apply to club
        officers.</p>

        <p>All eligible individuals who submit membership information to the club officers and who attend club events with
        "reasonable" frequency shall be considered voting members. A quorum shall consist of 50% of voting members.</p>

        <p>Regardless of an individual's eligibility for voting membership, all events shall be considered open to the community at
        large unless they involve voting or some other activity that university or SGA policy restricts. The only exceptions shall
        be events that the club officers or voting membership decide to close, for whatever reason they so choose. In general,
        members of the community at large should be welcomed as non-voting members in the UMBC-LUG.</p>

        <p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>

        <h3><a name="constitution_article4">Article IV: Officers</a></h3>

        <p>The Officers shall consist of the President, the Vice President, the Secretary, and the Treasurer, all of whom shall be
        voting members. One individual may occupy more than one position, subject only to the will of the membership and the
        regulations of the SGA.</p>

        <p>There shall also be an Advisor, who should meet the current SGA criteria for Student Organization Advisor. As of this
        writing, the Advisor must be a member of UMBC's faculty or staff.</p>

        <p>The officers and the advisor together comprise the UMBC-LUG executive board.</p>

        <p>The Secretary shall keep minutes of all meetings, and perform other duties as directed by the Executive Board.</p>

        <p>The Treasurer shall be responsible and accountable for all the organization's fiscal concerns. He or she shall keep
        detailed records of all transactions, and attend budgetary meetings with the SGA as required by the SGA. The treasurer will
        perform any other duties as directed by the Executive Board.</p>

        <p>The Vice President is the assistant to the President. He or she shall perform duties as directed by the Executive Board
        or delegated by the President.</p>

        <p>The President is ultimately responsible to perform all the work that needs to be done, except those responsibilities
        specifically assigned to other officers by the Executive Board or by this Constitution. The President, or the President's
        duly designated representative (preferably another officer), shall preside over all meetings of the LUG. The President is
        directly answerable to the voting membership.</p>

        <p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>

        <h3><a name="constitution_article5">Article V: Amending the Constitution</a></h3>

        <p>Any member may propose an amendment to the constitution. If the amendment is seconded, at least one week shall pass
        before a vote is taken on the amendment. If at least 2/3 of a quorum consisting of 2/3 of the active voting membership vote
        to support the amendment, the Constitution shall be duly amended.</p>

        <p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>

        <h3><a name="constitution_article6">Article VI: Elections</a></h3>

        <p>The Executive Board, supervised by the Advisor, shall hold regular elections. No more than 12 months should pass from
        one election to the next election, although more frequent elections are allowed. In all matters pertaining to elections,
        the Advisor, as a neutral party, is to have the final say. Preferably, elections will occur in early April, although an
        exact date is left to the executive board's discretion. The election of the new officers shall go into effect 1 month after
        the results are tallied, or at such time as the Executive Board deems appropriate. During the period of transition from the
        old officer-ship to the new officer-ship, the old officers are encouraged to take the new officers in hand and "show them
        the ropes."</p>

        <p>Elections shall be held with a minimum of one week's notice. The Executive Board is strongly encouraged to solicit votes
        using the broadest means as possible. Secure means of electronic voting, such as pgp-encrypted email, are encouraged,
        although such decisions are ultimately left to the Executive Board.</p>

        <p>All voting members shall be eligible for office.</p>
